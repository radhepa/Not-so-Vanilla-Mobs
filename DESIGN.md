## Hostile

### 1. Sporeling (zombie)
A zombie overgrown by fungus: red mushrooms grow from its head, shoulder and back, white
mycelium creeps over grey-violet skin, eyes glow spore-teal (emissive).
- Hit: Nausea 6 s + Poison I 3 s.
- Death: bursts into a poison spore cloud (radius 2.5, 5 s) and plants up to 3 mushrooms on nearby
  ground (only if `mobGriefing`).
- Burns in daylight like a zombie. Never converts in water. Never spawns as a baby.
- Drops: rotten flesh 0–2, red or brown mushroom 0–2.

### 2. Frostbitten (zombie)
A zombie frozen solid: pale blue skin, icicles on brow, shoulders and arms, a frosted scarf, frosty
breath. Eyes glow ice-blue.
- Hit: Slowness II 4 s and 7 s of powder-snow freezing.
- Immune to freezing. Does not burn in daylight. Never converts in water. No babies.
- Leaves a trail of snow layers on cold ground (only if `mobGriefing`).
- Drops: rotten flesh 0–2, snowball 0–3, ice (10%).

### 3. Briarbones (skeleton)
A skeleton strangled by jungle growth: vines wrap the ribs and limbs, thorny briars on the
shoulders, leaves sprouting from the skull, a mossy jaw.
- Bow archer. Arrows inflict Poison I 5 s.
- Thorns: melee attackers take 1 damage.
- Burns in daylight.
- Drops: bone 0–2, arrow 0–2, vine 0–2.

### 4. Gravewarden (skeleton)
A dead knight: a skeleton in rusted iron plate (helm with a slit visor, pauldrons, breastplate,
greaves), torn dark cape. Carries an iron sword and a shield. 15% larger than a skeleton.
- Melee only. 30 health, 8 armour, slow and heavy (knockback resistant).
- Shield: arrows and other projectiles that hit it from the front are deflected.
- Does not burn in daylight: its helm shields it.
- Drops: bone 1–3, iron nugget 1–4, iron sword (5%, damaged).

### 5. Bog Lurker
A huge mossy toad that ambushes from swamp water. Wide mouth, warty olive back covered in moss
and duckweed, pale belly, amber eyes.
- Sits perfectly still (camouflaged) until a player comes within 6 blocks, then leaps.
- Tongue lash: from 3 to 8 blocks away it lashes its tongue and yanks the target toward itself
  (every 4 s).
- Bite 5 damage, 24 health. Amphibious: swims, never drowns.
- Drops: slime ball 0–2, lily pad 0–1.

### 6. Gloomwing
A cave-dwelling bat-thing the size of a dog, with tattered membrane wings and pale glowing eyes.
- Flies erratically, then swoops. Each hit deals 2 damage and Darkness 4 s.
- 10 health. Burns in sunlight (it belongs underground).
- Spawns only underground (below y 40, no sky above).
- Drops: leather 0–1, glow ink sac (25%).

### 7. Dune Scorpion
A sandy-gold scorpion as long as a person is tall: armoured plates, two big pincers, a segmented
tail with a dark stinger.
- Burrows: lies hidden under sand when it has nothing to do, and bursts out when a player comes
  within 5 blocks.
- Pincers deal 4 damage; 30% of hits also sting (Poison I 5 s).
- Does not burn. Can spawn in daylight (it's a desert animal), but rarely.
- Drops: string 0–2, spider eye 0–1.

## Friendly

### 8. Mossback Tortoise
A big, slow tortoise with a little garden on its shell: moss, grass tufts, a flower or two.
- Shears: harvest the garden for moss blocks (1–2) and sometimes a flower; it regrows in about
  5 minutes.
- When hurt it pulls into its shell for 5 s and takes 70% less damage.
- 30 health, very slow. Breeds with melon slices.
- Drops: moss carpet 0–1.

### 9. Capybara
The calmest animal in the world. Round, brown, small ears, half-closed eyes.
- Small animals (chickens, rabbits, frogs, cats, foxes, parrots, baby animals) sometimes hop on its
  back and ride for a while.
- Comfort: a player crouching next to it gets Regeneration I.
- Swims well. 14 health. Breeds with sugar cane.
- Drops: leather 0–1.

## Pet

### 10. Wyrmling
A tiny dragon the size of a cat, with membrane wings, little horns and a spiked tail. Comes in
ember red.
- Wild ones live high up on mountain peaks and windswept hills (rare).
- Tame with blaze powder (1 in 4). Heals and breeds with blaze powder.
- Tamed: flies after its owner, sits when told (use with an empty hand), and spits embers at
  monsters that hurt its owner or that its owner attacks. Embers burn but never set blocks alight.
- Fire immune. 20 health.

## Compatibility

- Same Minecraft (26.3), Fabric Loader (0.19.5) and Fabric API (0.161.0+26.3) as Village Friends.
- No mixins into vanilla or Village Friends. Hostile mobs are ordinary `Monster`s, so Village
  Friends guards and pets treat them like any other monster.
- RPG add-on (`villagefriends_rpg`): an optional mixin, applied only when the add-on is installed,
  makes its Bestiary count Sporeling and Frostbitten as Zombies, Briarbones and Gravewarden as
  Skeletons, and Dune Scorpion as a Spider. Everything else earns normal kill XP.
